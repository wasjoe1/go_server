	Two Kinds of Errors (in programming):
	1. Compilation errors. Occur when code is compiled. It's generally better to have compilation errors because they'll never accidentally make it into production. You can't ship a program with a compiler error because the resulting executable won't even be created.
	2. Runtime errors. Occur when a program is running. These are generally worse because they can cause your program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
	
	* i.e. compilation err could be wrong syntax causes code to not compile
	* i.e. run time could be doing 1/0 => program was running just that an err happened during runtime
